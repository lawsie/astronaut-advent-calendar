# Astronaut Advent Calendar

What does an astronaut use for an advent calendar? An AstroPi of course!

Here is the code for a full Astronaut Advent Calendar which runs on a Raspberry Pi with an attached Sense HAT.

To install the Advent Calendar on your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/lawsie/astronaut-advent-calendar.git
```
Then when you have the files, run the file `astro_advent.py` in Python 3

```bash
python3 astro_advent.py
```

You can also run the Astronaut Advent Calendar with the Sense HAT emulator if you don't have the Sense HAT hardware.

## Instructions
